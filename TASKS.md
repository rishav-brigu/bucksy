## Success Metrics for Week 1

- **Code Quality**: All code passes linting and has test coverage >80%
- **Performance**: Page load times under 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Security**: All security rules tested and no critical vulnerabilities
- **Functionality**: Core user flows (auth, expense creation, budget setting) work end-to-end
- **Deployment**: Successful automated deployment to production environment

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Firebase Learning Curve**: Allocate extra time for Firebase documentation review
- **Complex UI Requirements**: Use proven UI libraries (shadcn/ui) to speed development
- **Authentication Complexity**: Start with simple email/password, add social auth later
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-have features to week 2

## Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)

- Advanced expense categorization and tagging
- Receipt scanning and OCR integration
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Data import/export improvements
- Performance optimization and caching
- Advanced budgeting features (recurring, multi-category)
- Mobile app considerations and PWA features
